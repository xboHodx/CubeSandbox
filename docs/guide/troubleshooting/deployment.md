| `/data/cubelet` must be on XFS (reflink) | `cubelet` stores container writable layers under `/data/cubelet` and relies on XFS reflink. Deploying on ext4-rooted hosts (Ubuntu / Debian / WSL) makes the one-click pre-flight reject with `not XFS`. Workaround: mount a loopback `.img` formatted as XFS at `/data/cubelet`. For production, attach a dedicated XFS data disk (100–300 GiB). For fresh installs prefer OpenCloudOS 9 / RHEL family. | [#311](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/issues/311), [#245](https://github.com/TencentCloud/CubeSandbox/issues/245) |
| Template Creation Times Out When the Sandbox CIDR Overlaps the LAN | The one-click deployment defaults the sandbox network to `192.168.0.0/18`. If the host LAN also uses `192.168.1.x`, Cube may allocate sandbox IPs that overlap the physical network, causing template creation or port probing to fail with `context deadline exceeded`. Change the Cubelet CIDR to a non-overlapping range and remove the old TAP devices plus `cube-dev` before restarting. | [Guide](./local-network-cidr-conflict.md) |
